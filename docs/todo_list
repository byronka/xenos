DONE 436- There needs to be a confirmation page after judging DONE

DONE 437 - The section on the judging page for choosing "happy" or "sad" needs to
be more pronounced.  Susanne was doing the ranking and didn't realize
she left it on "sad".  Perhaps in addition to make it more visually
pronounced, set the a third radio option for "neither" so if the user
moves forward without selecting happy or sad, they are stopped.  Or,
it might be possible to have neither radio button selected when they
hit the page, effecting the same situation as a third, neutral option. DONE
