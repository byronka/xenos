when first enter message on offering to handle, where it shows
number of seconds since this happened, starts with just showing a colon.
At refresh, shows "6 seconds ago" or whatever.

When sending a message to multiple potential handlers, after sending
it's not possible to tell who you sent that message to.

Confirm new password in change password.

If two people offer to handle a favor, it lists the favor two times,
on the dropdown menu off the header.

Sad favr on ranking user not sad enough.

Allow multiple people to set the same email.

Make the text like "24 minutes ago" MUCH smaller.

On user_groups page, make it "my profile" instead of "cancel"

looking at groups for someone who is in multiple groups with me, it
shows as a jumble - instead make it like how it shows on a
requestoffer.

when I create a username with chinese characters, on register_password
it doesn't show characters correctly.

The whole "cancellation" concept for requestoffers needs clearer
verbage and on the actual page to confirm a cancel, need a cancel
button to cancel the cancel.

after cancelling or completion, take them straight to judge.jsp if
they click the button.

On profile, show smilies / frownies instead of +1 / -1

why isn't there a list of favors I've handled on My Favors?
