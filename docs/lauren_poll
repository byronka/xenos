start new members at 5.  Don't want them starting at 0 - demoralizing
start accumulating points at that point
don't want people taking advantage - they always use it, never do for others - cannot use more hours than you have.
monthly - officers get 5 hours each a month - always get birthday hours, but use or lose.
not-tech-people have to be able to use.  Super simple.
email out to people in group if they make a favor - a lot more capability for emails / SMS going out
reports - members of group want to see what's going on
simple-down the user interface a TON - offers, offering, handling
general awareness of where other people in the group are - reports
favors should only be shown to other group members - "don't want creepy people around my kids"
I feel like I'm not in a group
sense of security
have to be approved to be part of the group
officers -people who are allowed to invite to group - set them, change them
40 women earlier.  Huge.  close-knit relationship wasn't always there.  Pretty easy to , in smaller situation, if we should ever grow again.  you don't know everybody.
worried all the time about new members - 
no one has to remember anything now.
rate of system right now - "we don't go out enough" use group for different reasons - to get to know other moms in area.
watch multiple kids from multiple families - 
advertising - send to email list.  
first kid 1 hour = 1 point, every other kid 0.5 points
