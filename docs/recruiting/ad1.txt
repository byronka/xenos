* Shallow learning curve - The fewest possible number of frameworks
  and libraries were used.

* Pick the number of hours you want to work weekly - 2 hours a 
  week or 40, anything goes
* Opportunity to learn the deep levels of a few key technologies
* Quality, not quantity - move slow but do it right, and no distractions
* Culture of light, elegant, simple code
* Work remote from anywhere - no travel required

What we are looking for:

    or passion.  Pick one or more.  
  - ability to program or willingness to learn
  - willingness to use a simplistic style of coding - no big
    machines here. Terms we have tattooed on our shoulders
    (figuratively speaking, ha ha): KISS, YAGNI.
