Much of the development material attempts to be self-documenting.
However, a little extra time spent explaining things can help ease the
transition into a new project.  That is what this document is for.

Utilities
=========

Exuberant Ctags -
use of the program "exuberant ctags" can make navigation of the code
base faster.  That program creates an index of symbols used in the code;
method names, variables, classes, and so on.  It provides this to Vim
and Emacs for quick navigation.  In Vim, you can press ctrl+[ to visit
the definition of a given method, and ctrl+T to return.

To create this index, run the program
  $QARMA_HOME/utils/run_ctags.sh

This will create a file called "tags" in your $QARMA_HOME directory,
which will be around 25 megabytes or larger.

Using that file with Vim requires Vim to know about it.  You can do
this by adding the following to your vimrc file:

:set tags=./tags;~/Projects

(add this to your .vimrc). This makes Vim look for a file named tags
first in its current directory, then in its parent directory, and so
on recursively up to containing directory ~/Projects.)

Lint4J - 
A lint program that does static analysis on the code to find any problems.
