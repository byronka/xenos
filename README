Things you need for this project:
=================================
A copy of OpenJdk for Java 1.7
MySQL version 5.  We tested on mysql-5.1.73-3.el6_5.x86_64
An operating system.  This was tested on Linux, it may work on Windows.


Getting started
===============
===============

Installing OpenJdk
------------------

For CentOS:
sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk

For Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre

Installing MySQL
----------------

For CentOS:
sudo yum install mysql-server              #install it
sudo /sbin/service mysqld start            #start it
sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation    #set password
sudo chkconfig mysqld on                   #set to run on startup

For Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server         #install it
sudo netstat -tap | grep mysql            #check if running
sudo service mysql restart                #start if necessary


Environment variables
---------------------

There is a script called set_env.sh which will try to get the
proper values for JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME, and CATALINA_HOME.  Of these,
JAVA_HOME is the tricky one, since the other two are in this directory!

If you already know the values for JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME, and CATALINA_HOME,
just set them; otherwise, to use set_env.sh to set values to your
environment variables, simply make it executable if it's not already and
run: 

./set_env.sh

Directories and files at the top:
=================================

lib - library files used by the project

lib_src - source for the library files

src - source files of the project, including web files (jsp, css.,
  etc.).  **This is where you do your work**.  Compiled work will be
  placed in the build directory, and client files (css, jsp, htm) will
  be copied from this location into the web container webapp directory.

web_container - contains documents and binaries for the web
  container, Tomcat.

ant - holds the utility we use for many benefits on our project.
  A Neat Tool.

build - where the built work goes.  We copy from there to where
  it belongs.

build.xml - the Ant script that provides all sorts of benefits, for
  example, building the project. Note: it is very important that this
  file remain where it is, at the root of the project.  Otherwise, it
  may end up creating and deleting directories in unexpected places.

db_scripts - holds scripts necessary to built the database schema.

Environment variables you need:
===============================

ANT_HOME should point to the Ant project in this folder. You need it
  to run the ant scripts that make development easy.

JAVA_HOME should point to a Java 1.7 OpenJdk directory.  Ant needs it
  to build the source.

CATALINA_HOME should point to the Tomcat directory.  The Tomcat
  scripts need this.

Environment variables you may want:
==================================

QARMA_HOME should point to the root of the directory, the directory
  with build.xml

QARMA_APP should point to the qarma web application in the web container.
