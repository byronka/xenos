Helpful information getting started with this project:

Things you need for this project:
=================================
A copy of OpenJdk for Java 1.7
MySQL version 5.  We tested on mysql-5.1.73-3.el6_5.x86_64
An operating system.  This was tested on Linux, it may work on Windows.

Getting started
===============
===============

Installing OpenJdk
------------------
For CentOS:
sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk

Installing MySQL
----------------
For CentOS:
sudo yum install mysql-server              #install it
sudo /sbin/service mysqld start            #start it
sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation    #set password
sudo chkconfig mysqld on                   #set to run on startup

Environment variables
---------------------
I created a script called set_env.sh which will try to get the
proper values for JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME, and CATALINA_HOME.  Of these,
JAVA_HOME is the tricky one, since the other two are in this directory!

To use set_env.sh to set values to your environment variables, simply
make it executable if it's not already and run:

source set_env.sh

Directories and files at the top:
=================================
lib - library files used by the project
lib_src - source for the library files
src - source files of the project
web_container - contains documents and binaries for the web container, Tomcat.
ant - holds the utility we use for many benefits on our project.  A Neat Tool.
build - where the built work goes.  We copy from there to where it belongs.
build.xml - the Ant script that provides all sorts of benefits, for example, building the project.
db_scripts - holds scripts necessary to built the database schema.

Environment variables you want:
===============================
ANT_HOME should point to the Ant project in this folder.
JAVA_HOME should point to a Java 1.7 OpenJdk directory
CATALINA_HOME should point to the Tomcat directory
