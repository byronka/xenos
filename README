If you have already set up everything, just type:

  ant run-initial

=================
1) Dependencies
=================

OpenJdk 1.7
MySQL 5.5
Linux


Installing OpenJdk
------------------

For CentOS:
sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk

For Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre

Installing MySQL
----------------

For CentOS:
read the info at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-repo-excerpt/5.6/en/linux-installation-yum-repo.html

For Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server         #install it
sudo netstat -tap | grep mysql            #check if running
sudo service mysql restart                #start if necessary


Now, set up a user, qarmauser and a password of password1

First, use the mysql program to connect to the server as the 
MySQL root user:

shell> mysql --user=root mysql

If you have assigned a password to the root account, you will also
need to supply a --password or -p option, 

Second, use the mysql command to add our user:
mysql> CREATE USER 'qarmauser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password1';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'qarmauser'@'localhost'WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> CREATE USER 'qarmauser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password1';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'qarmauser'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;







========================
2) Environment variables
========================

There is a script called set_env.sh which will try to get the
proper values for JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME, and CATALINA_HOME.  Of these,
JAVA_HOME is the tricky one, since the other two are in this directory!

If you already know the values for JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME, and CATALINA_HOME,
just set them.  They may be as follows:

ANT_HOME=$LOCATION_OF_QARMA_FOLDER/ant/apache-ant-1.9.4
CATALINA_HOME=$LOCATION_OF_QARMA_FOLDER/web_container/apache-tomcat-8.0.14

For Ubuntu:
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64

For CentOS:
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.65.x86_64

If you want to use a script to search for your JAVA_HOME, just run:

utils/set_env.sh

ANT_HOME should point to the Ant project in this folder. You need it
  to run the ant scripts that make development easy.

JAVA_HOME should point to a Java 1.7 OpenJdk directory.  Ant needs it
  to build the source.

CATALINA_HOME should point to the Tomcat directory.  The Tomcat
  scripts need this.





====================================
3) Directories and files at the top:
====================================

build/ - where the built work goes.  Won't exist until you build.

build.xml - the Ant script that provides all sorts of benefits, for
  example, building the project. Note: it is very important that this
  file remain where it is, at the root of the project.  Otherwise, it
  may end up creating and deleting directories in unexpected places.

db_scripts/ - holds scripts necessary to built the database schema.

docs/ - documentation for the project.

lib/ - library files used by the project

src/ - source files of the project Compiled code will be placed in the build
  directory

utils/ - some utilities helpful for development.

web_container/ - contains documents and binaries for the web container,
  Tomcat.  Also contains the qarma web application and its client files.
