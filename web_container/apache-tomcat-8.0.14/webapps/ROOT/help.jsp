<h3>Favrcafe</h3>

<p>
Have you ever done a favor for someone and wish someone had been keeping track?  Even though we usually do such things in a sense of selflessness, there's a part of us that want to earn the credit for those good things we've done.
</p>

Anonymous
<p>
Choose any available user alias.  You are not restricted to one account either - make as many as you want.  You may add your email for some added benefits, but it's not necessary

Secure
<p>
Core developers prior experience was with nationally known security companies and with confidential healthcare information.  When it comes to privacy and security, it's one of our highest priorities.
</p>

Safe
<p>
Not just anyone is allowed into the system.  You have to be invited in.  By serving the requests of others, users build a reputation that shows both their overall averages as well as recent activity.
