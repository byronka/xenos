<h3>Favrcafe</h3>
<p>
Have you ever done a favor for someone and wish someone had been keeping track?  Even though we usually do such things in a sense of selflessness, there's a part of us that want to earn the credit for those good things we've done.
</p>

<h3>Anonymous</h3>
<p>
Choose any available user alias.  You are not restricted to one account either - make as many as you want.  You may add your email for some added benefits, but it's not necessary

<h3>Secure</h3>
<p>
Core developers prior experience was with nationally known security companies and with confidential healthcare information.  When it comes to privacy and security, it's one of our highest priorities.
</p>

<h3>Safe</h3>
<p>
Not just anyone is allowed into the system.  You have to be invited in.  By serving the requests of others, users build a reputation that shows both their overall averages as well as recent activity. (not currently active - in beta, anyone can join)
</p>


<h3>Choose a username</h3>
<p>click on register and pick a username that no one else has</p>
<h3>Choose a password</h3>
<p> password must be 8 characters minimum </p>
<h3>Set your location</h3>
<p>click on "my profile" and then the "current location" button, and enter your country and postal code.</p>
<h3> Create a request for a favor </h3>
<p>On the header, click the "Request Favor" button and choose 
if this favor needs a location.  If it does, go ahead and enter than
information.  Then, select a category for the favor and enter
necessary information about it.  Be concise and clear - otherwise
people won't help you.
<h3> What's the point of a favor </h3>
If you handle the favor successfully, you will have earned points that
can be used to purchsae other favors.
<h3>Points</h3>
<p>Points can be used in any of the categories.  For example, you
might earn a point by babysitting and then turn around and spend it on
taxi.</p>
<h3> Reputation </h3>
<p>As you proceed in Favrcafe, you will make and handle favors.  In so
doing, there will be opportunities to be ranked for how you are
handling or requesting favors.  As time goes on, this will make it
easier for you to work in a favor-based economy.
<h3> location or no location?  </h3>
<p>Locations are best for favors that need to have a person present,
such as for taxi or babysitting.  Other favors, such as finding out
some information on the web, don't require that people be nearby, so
you don't need to set a location for those.  The process of setting a
location simply sets a postal code for the favor - that's as granular
as it gets for public viewing.  People will be able to search your
favor that way.  Once a handler is chosen, it will be possible to give
more detailed locatio information in the conversation part of the
favor.</p>
<h3> publish the favor </h3>
<p>When you first create the favor, it is in draft mode - no one else
can see it.  Once you publish it, anyone can see and search it.
</p>
<h3> retract the favor </h3>
<p>If you want to unpublish the favor, click on the "retract" button.
At that point you will be the only one who can see it.</p>
<p>
Favors will stay open for a week, then revert to draft if no one handles it.
</p>
<h3> Search for a favor you can handle </h3>
<p>Click the search button on the header.  It will provide a variety
of ways to search for favors, including date, distance from your
current location, postal code, and more.</p>
<h3> Offer to handle a favor </h3>
<p>If you see a favor you want to handle, click on it and click the
handle button.  Once you offer to handle, a message will be sent to
the owner of that favor indicating you want to handle it.  Note that
other users may also have offered to handle the favor.  Your chances
of being picked will go up if you have a higher ranking or you are in
a group with that user.</p>
<h3> Communicate during offering period </h3>
<p>During the period of time where you have offered to handle the
favor but you haven't yet been chosen, you can speak to the owner of
that favor by going to the "My favors" button and clicking on the
favor you offered on.  There, you will have the ability to send a
message to the owner.</p.
<h3> Handle a favor </h3>
<p>If you have been chosen to handle the favor, you will receive an
email about it.  Congrats!  Now, you are expected to open that favor
in Favrcafe and have a conversation detailing what the Favor owner
wants done. </p>
<h3> Complete the favor / Cancel a favor </h3>
<p>Once the conversation and actions have taken place, the owner is
allowed to click "complete transation" to close out the favor.  Once
they do so, both parties will be given the ability to rank the other
party for whether they were happy or sad about the outcome.</p>
<h3> Rank each other </h3>
<p>Ranking is easy.  In "my profile" you will see a list of buttons at
the bottom indicating which users you need to rank.  Just click there
and follow the prompts</p>
<h3> create a group </h3>
<p>You can create a group by going to "My profile" and then "Your
groups".  You may create as many groups as you want, with any name.
Once the group is created, you must invite users by username.  The
username must be entered verbatim.  If you have friends using the
system, ask them their username and enter it in the box.</p>
<h3> get invited to a group </h3>
<p>If you are invited to a group, there will an alert indicator on the
"My profile" button in the header.  Click there, and then on "Your
groups", and there will be a section mentioning your group invites.
Click there, and then accept or reject the group invite.</p>
<h3> benefits of groups </h3>
<p>Being in a group has some benefits.  If you click on a username in
the system and that user is in your group, it will indicate that in
"shared groups".  If you look at that group, you can see all the
members.  Clicking on any user will show their current open favors.
So for example, perhaps you are a member of a babysitting co-op in
your neighborhood.  You could create a group called "neighborhood
moms" and invite the users.  Then you can see babysitting requests
from the other members and handle them.
<h3> setting description for yourself in group </h3>
<p>The description you set for yourself in the group can only be seen
by other members of that group.</p>
<h3> setting description for yourself in "my profile" </h3>
<p>The description you set for yourself in "my profile" is public.</p>
<h3> Review My Favors button - desktop and mobile.  </h3>
<p>If you are using Favrcafe on a desktop browser, you can hover over
"my Favors" and see a dropdown of the current state of things - your
open favors, taken favors, etc.  On the mobile device this is not
available, but you can click on the "my Favors" button to see the
state of things</p>
<p>
You will remain logged into the system for a week past your most recent activity
